# Code Super Mario Bros. in JavaScript

Create a Super Mario game in vanilla JavaScript from scratch. 


## Running

* Clone repository.
* Run `npm install`.
* Run `npm start`.
* Go to `http://localhost:5000`.



## Contributing

Please contribute if you see something wrong, but I can unforunately not merge your PR directly into 
`master` as I use Git commits as a script for creating the tutorial and commits out of sequence would throw me off.
